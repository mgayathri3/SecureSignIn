I am building a full-stack user authentication system as a portfolio project for an internship. Please generate a working, complete project with the following specifications and enhancements implemented in the actual code.✅ Core Functional Requirements:Signup Page:Users can register with:usernamepasswordemailrole (Admin or Student)Store login credentials securely in MySQL using prepared statementsHash passwords using bcryptjsCheck if username already existsValidate password strength (weak/medium/strong) using regex and show a strength meterLogin Page:Validate login credentialsOn success, save session in localStorageUpdate and store the last login timestamp in MySQLProfile Page:Fetch profile info from MongoDBAllow user to view and update:AgeDate of BirthContact NumberProfile Picture Upload (base64 or public file path)Display role and last login time🛠️ Tech Stack:Frontend: React, HTML/CSS/JS, Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap)Backend: Node.js + ExpressDatabases:MySQL for login credentialsMongoDB for profile dataSession: localStorage only (no cookies, no JWTs)Icons: SVG onlyFonts: Max 2 fonts from Google Fonts✨ Implement These Enhancements:✅ Password strength checker on Signup (visual meter)✅ Real-time username availability check (AJAX-style validation)✅ Responsive, mobile-first layout using Tailwind✅ Profile picture upload with preview✅ Display user’s last login date on Profile page✅ Role-based display (show “Welcome Admin” or “Welcome Student”)✅ Toast-style feedback messages for success/error events✅ .env.example file for MySQL, MongoDB, PORT, etc.✅ Sample MySQL and MongoDB schema/setup instructions✅ README.md that includes:Project overviewFolder structureLive demo link (if hosted)Tech stack badgesGIF or screenshot walkthroughimport Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline/next';export default function Home() {return (<main>  <Spline    scene="https://prod.spline.design/7aDD93JdwGEjvekB/scene.splinecode"   /></main>);}use this for prompt as the robot is hidden back oof the authentication page make it visible place it side and make the page attractive match the color coombination .make as dark mode and light mode📁 Folder StructurecppCopyEditproject-root/├── html/ (optional if using React routing)├── css/├── js/├── assets/icons/├── backend/│   ├── db/│   │   ├── mysql_connection.js│   │   └── mongo_connection.js│   ├── register.js│   ├── login.js│   └── profile_update.js├── .env.example├── README.md└── .gitignore📤 Output Instructions:Generate the full working source code (frontend and backend)React components should be function-basedBackend should include input validation and error handlingMySQL must use prepared statementsPasswords must be hashed with bcryptMongoDB should be used for profile storageAvoid external image files — use SVG or base64Please generate the full stack application with all these features and polish included. This project will be submitted for review in a real internship application.enhance the styling make the authenticatin logo and below infrmation visible as the robot is there adjust in such a both become visible also add dark mode and light option , remove the logo built with spline , add any moving background that suits this project also after logging in maintain the same color combination
